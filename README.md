## Hi there, I'm Khoa 👋

**🎯**  
I’m a data engineer/AI engineer and medical doctor. 
My expertise bridges the gap between technology, research and medicine. I thrive in delivering data and AI solutions that provide meaningful and immediate value.

**💻 Technology Solutions**  
I build scalable data architectures and ETL pipelines across AWS, GCP, and Snowflake, including transformations with dbt, real-time processing with Kafka, dashboarding with Looker, and workflow orchestration using Airflow and Dagster. I also use n8n to automate repetitive workflows and reduce operational overhead. Further, I've implemented AI models for time-series prediction (Temporal Convolutional Networks, Gated-Recurrent-Units, Attention-Transformer) and LLM- and RAG-based systems for efficient knowledge retrieval.

My experience in different industries helps me to apply best practices, creating reliable and scalable solutions.

**🧠 AI Research**  
I engage in academic research on AI, developing frameworks and evaluation methods to ensure AI tools perform reliably in real-world hospital settings. I have examined the applicability of deep learning algorithms for the prediction of blood poisoning (sepsis). My work has been awarded at renowned international conferences (APAMI) and national conferences (BSRT-Symposium). 
I'm also a researcher at the international research center "BIH Center for Regenerative Therapies" (BCRT) and at Helmholtz Research in Data Science (HEIBRiDS).
